Sure, here are some problems based on combinational and sequential circuits in Verilog:

1. **Combinational Circuit Problem**: Design a 4:1 multiplexer using Verilog. The multiplexer selects one of the 4-bit inputs depending upon the value of two control lines.

2. **Sequential Circuit Problem**: Design a sequence detector that detects the sequence "110" in a serial input using Moore and Mealy machines.

3. **Combinational Circuit Problem**: Design a 4-bit magnitude comparator. The comparator should take two 4-bit inputs and give three outputs - A greater than B, A equals B, and A less than B.

4. **Implement a Car Park Controller**: Design a car park controller in Verilog. The car park has a capacity of 10 cars. It should have inputs for car entry and exit and should display the number of cars currently in the park. If the park is full, it should not allow entry of more cars.
